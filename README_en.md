## Why this extension?

<details>
<summary>Main reasons (rambling ahead):</summary>
<br />

1. When Chrome‚Äôs default search engine is set to something other than Google,
   the new tab page has no search bar or wallpaper.
2. Setting Chrome‚Äôs search engine to Bing makes the new tab page resemble
   Edge‚Äôs Bing homepage‚Äîwith cluttered buttons, ugly news, and search bar/shortcuts
   placed too high.
3. I like Lime Start Page‚Äôs look, but it performs an HTTP request every time it opens.
   Strictly speaking, it‚Äôs a navigation page, not a start page
   (never understood why it‚Äôs server-hosted).
4. Lime Start Page is not a native browser extension and doesn‚Äôt support displaying
   frequently visited sites (again, baffling), while I prefer quick access to them.
5. Lime Start Page places shortcuts on a secondary page, but I want them on the main tab.
   Although you can default to that page, it hides the search bar.
6. Lime Start Page isn‚Äôt open source, making it hard to customize‚Äîso I decided
   to build my own based on my needs.

> ~~Heard Lime Start Page was getting a full refactor with new features,~~
> ~~maybe I‚Äôll stop updating then?~~  
> It got updated, but mostly UI tweaks, not many new features (lol).

This project is built with Vue 3 (TypeScript) + Element Plus.

> [!NOTE]  
> I haven‚Äôt systematically studied HTML / CSS / JS / TS / Vue,
> so code quality may not be high. Issues and PRs are welcome.

## Known Issues

1. Some Chromium-based browsers on Windows may freeze at startup.
   Disabling **GPU hardware acceleration** or switching  
   **Choose ANGLE graphics backend** to `OpenGL` in
   [Experiments](chrome://flags/#use-angle) can help.
   > - Likely caused by GPU driver or system issues.
   > - Chromium discourages rendering via OpenGL API, but other settings may also help (might reduce stutter but risk frame drops).
