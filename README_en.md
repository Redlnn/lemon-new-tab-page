## Known Issues

1. Some Chromium-based browsers on Windows may freeze at startup.
   Disabling **GPU hardware acceleration** or switching  
   **Choose ANGLE graphics backend** to `OpenGL` in
   [Experiments](chrome://flags/#use-angle) can help.
   > - Likely caused by GPU driver or system issues.
   > - Chromium discourages rendering via OpenGL API, but other settings may also help (might reduce stutter but risk frame drops).
