          The wallpaper caching strategy depends on the browser, and wallpapers
          may not be accessible offline.
        c: >-
          There will be a blank screen before the wallpaper finishes loading,
          and the duration depends on your internet speed.
        d: >-
          Please ensure the wallpaper API you are using allows cross-origin
          requests; otherwise, it will fail to load.

        Are you sure you want to use SVG images? To avoid XSS and XXE attacks,
        Lemon New Tab will process the image, so it may cause the SVG image not
        to be displayed as expected. But even after processing, you may still be
        attacked by the image you choose, so make sure the image source you use
        is safe.
